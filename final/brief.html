                <h2>Final Project Design Brief</h2>
                
                <p>I’m planning to update Mad Libs 2.0 Project to make it look more sophisticated and improve the user experience with more engaging visuals and UI elements. Compared to the other two projects, the Mad Libs project is more interactive and data-based. However, it still has interactive and fun user experience aspects like Every Pictures and Game On projects.
                </p>
        
                <p>My ultimate goal for this project is to improve the interaction and experience for users to enjoy and have fun with it without hassle. To achieve this goal, I plan to improve the Mad Libs project by using better visual hierarchy, and unique typography as well as additional styles for clickable text to make it look like a button to improve usability. </p>

                <p>I’m also considering creating more illustrations for each zodiac sign according to the birthday users' input.  In terms of interaction strategies, I want to improve the time-based behavior to make the transition between the form page and the result page look smoother.
