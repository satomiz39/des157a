                <p>In this article, I leaned that practicing looking at images in this case photos carefully help you notice details and make observations. Also, interpreting and analyzing what is going on in the photo you observe helps foster your reading and visual thinking skills.
                </p><br>

                <p>The photo example by Rodrigo Abd was so impactful to me. At first look, I was not really sure what was going on in the photo. All I could see was this bizarre scene in which a guy’s half face is peeking from the water on a street. And a man on a motorcycle is staring at the guy. As I read the story behind the photos, I was surprised that how the one image contains so much important information and symbolizes the unstable and fragile political situation in Venezuela.

                 I found picked a website design from Unseen Studio which uses beautiful images and interaction in a very unique way. From the landing page, you can immediately have an immersive experience through the interactive user interface.

                <p>I had never thought deeply about the use of overlay and how it affects usability and user experience until I read this week’s article Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes by Kathryn Whitenton. The example of Apple.com changing the Apple’s MobileMe support section design from having a Modal window to simply displaying the content as a full new page (Whitenton, 2015) made me realize how important it is to use “the five W’s – Who, What, When, Where, and Why” (Whitenton, 2015). In addition to following the standard guidelines when you use overlays on your website page, you have to really think and examine if using overlay is the right solution for your users and certain web pages</p><br>

                <p>As the author mentioned in the article, using overlay can be a great way to display form and information in certain contexts but without careful consideration and planning, it can result in unintended consequences and inconveniences for users.</p>

                <p>As I read the article Best practices for form design by Salim Ansari, I learned that are many ways to improve usability and user experience when you design forms. When I was working on a website or mobile application design project, I did not really think about how a form plays an important role in conversion that would impact business goals. For example, the method of minimizing the number of fields by “chunking the form into several steps” (Ansari, 2020) definitely helps users from getting frustrated by filling in a large number of input fields. By providing a visual representation that shows where you are in the process of filling out forms, you can reduce the users’ cognitive load and the friction that prevents users from completing their tasks which improves user experience.</p><br>
                <p>A website form that I have interacted with, and that I think exemplifies best practices in designing forms is Airbnb because it is very clear and easy to understand and navigate. The way they labeled each input field is also self explanatory and increases accessibility. </p>
