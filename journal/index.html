                <p>As I read the article Best practices for form design by Salim Ansari, I learned that are many ways to improve usability and user experience when you design forms. When I was working on a website or mobile application design project, I did not really think about how a form plays an important role in conversion that would impact business goals. 

                <p>For example, the method of minimizing the number of fields by “chunking the form into several steps” (Ansari, 2020) definitely helps users from getting frustrated by filling in a large number of input fields. By providing a visual representation that shows where you are in the process of filling out forms, you can reduce the users’ cognitive load and the friction that prevents users from completing their tasks which improves user experience. 
                <br>
                A website form that I have interacted with, and that I think exemplifies best practices in designing forms is Airbnb because it is very clear and easy to understand and navigate. The way they labeled each input field is also self explanatory and increases accessibility.
